A metric alarm  ---
watches a single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on CloudWatch metrics.
The alarm performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric or expression relative to a threshold over a number of time periods. 
you can Create up to 5,000 alarms per Region per AWS account.

OK   -----means the metric is within the defined threshold.
ALARM ----means the metric is outside the defined threshold.
INSUFFICIENT_DATA ------means enough information has yet to be gathered that can determine whether the metric is within or outside of the threshold range.



Log events
–
Log events are a record of some activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored. 
The log event record that CloudWatch Logs understands contains two properties: the timestamp of when the event occurred, 
and the raw event message. Event messages must be UTF-8 encoded.


Log streams
–
Log streams are a sequence of log events that share the same source. More specifically,
a log stream is generally intended to represent the sequence of events coming from the application instance or resource being monitored. 


Log groups  -
define groups of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Each log stream has to belong to one log group. For example, if you have a separate log stream for the Apache access logs from each host, 
you can group those log streams into a single log group called MyWebsite.com/Apache/access_log.
